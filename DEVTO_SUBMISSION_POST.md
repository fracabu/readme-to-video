*This is a submission for the [DEV's Worldwide Show and Tell Challenge Presented by Mux](https://dev.to/challenges/mux-2025-12-03)*

## What I Built

**README2Video** is a web application that automatically transforms GitHub README files into professional promotional videos.

```
README.md → AI Analysis → Video Generation → Mux Streaming → Share!
```

Paste a GitHub URL, choose your style, and get a cinematic promo video in minutes. No editing skills required.

## My Pitch Video

{% embed https://stream.mux.com/9dgSGD1XGzVm3YOSCslXgrgFbAkiKFCOksgXtUYlvDs.m3u8 %}

> **Meta twist**: This pitch video was generated by README2Video itself, from its own README. The app pitched itself. 🎬

### Video Preview (Powered by Mux)

Here's an animated preview generated automatically by Mux:

## Demo

- **Live App**: [readme-to-video.onrender.com](https://readme-to-video.onrender.com/)
- **GitHub Repo**: [github.com/fracabu/readme-to-video](https://github.com/fracabu/readme-to-video)

### How to Test (2 minutes setup, all free!)

The app uses BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) - this keeps costs transparent and gives you full control.

| Service | How to Get Key | Cost |
|---------|----------------|------|
| **Mux** | [mux.com](https://www.mux.com/) - Create free account | Free (no credit card) |
| **OpenRouter** | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) - Sign up, get API key | Free models available! |
| **Kie.ai** | [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/) - Sign up, get API key | Free credits on signup |

**Free models tip**: In OpenRouter, select models ending with `:free` like `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free` or `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`.

## The Story Behind It

Every developer knows this pain: you build something amazing, but creating a promo video takes hours (or days), costs money, and requires skills you don't have.

I wanted to solve this for myself and every developer out there.

The solution? Let AI do the heavy lifting:
1. **Analyze** the README to understand what the project does
2. **Generate** a compelling script with scenes
3. **Create** stunning visuals with Sora 2
4. **Host** on Mux for instant streaming

Now any developer can go from README to promo video in under 5 minutes.

---

## The Opportunity

There are **300+ million repositories** on GitHub. Every single one could benefit from a promo video.

- Indie developers launching products
- Open source projects seeking contributors
- Startups pitching to investors
- Students showcasing portfolios

README2Video turns a $500+ video production into a **$2 automated process**. That's the kind of democratization that scales.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **LLM** | Multi-provider: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, OpenRouter (free tier!) |
| **Video AI** | Kie.ai Sora 2 - cinematic text-to-video |
| **Streaming** | Mux Video API |
| **Real-time** | Server-Sent Events for live progress |

### Key Features

- **Multi-Provider LLM**: Choose between Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or free models via OpenRouter
- **Video Styles**: Tech, Minimal, or Energetic aesthetics
- **Durations**: 15s, 30s, or 60s videos
- **Real-time Progress**: SSE updates showing each generation step
- **BYOK Model**: Users bring their own API keys - no hidden costs, full transparency

## Use of Mux (Additional Prize Category)

README2Video leverages **6 distinct Mux features** to deliver a seamless video experience:

### 1. Programmatic Upload API

Videos generated by Sora 2 are uploaded directly to Mux via the Node SDK:

```javascript
import Mux from '@mux/mux-node';

const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET,
});

// Upload generated video to Mux
const asset = await mux.video.assets.create({
  input: [{ url: generatedVideoUrl }],
  playback_policy: ['public'],
  encoding_tier: 'baseline'
});
```

### 2. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

Mux automatically transcodes every video into multiple resolutions and bitrates. Users get smooth playback regardless of their connection:

```javascript
// Mux handles all transcoding automatically
// Users stream at optimal quality for their bandwidth
const streamUrl = `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}.m3u8`;
```

### 3. Playback URL Generation

Each video gets a unique, shareable streaming URL:

```javascript
// Get the playback ID from the asset
const playbackId = asset.playback_ids[0].id;

// Generate streaming URL (HLS format)
const streamUrl = `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}.m3u8`;

// Generate direct MP4 for download
const mp4Url = `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}/medium.mp4`;
```

### 4. Dynamic Thumbnails

Mux generates thumbnails at any timestamp - perfect for social sharing:

```javascript
// Thumbnail at specific time (in seconds)
const thumbnail = `https://image.mux.com/${playbackId}/thumbnail.png?time=5`;

// Custom dimensions
const customThumb = `https://image.mux.com/${playbackId}/thumbnail.png?time=10&width=1280&height=720`;
```

**Example** - Dynamic thumbnail from our pitch video:

![Dynamic Thumbnail](https://image.mux.com/9dgSGD1XGzVm3YOSCslXgrgFbAkiKFCOksgXtUYlvDs/thumbnail.png?time=8&width=640)

### 5. Animated GIF Previews

Generate eye-catching GIF previews for social media and documentation:

```javascript
// Animated GIF from any segment
const gifPreview = `https://image.mux.com/${playbackId}/animated.gif?start=0&end=10&width=480`;

// Customize FPS for smaller file size
const optimizedGif = `https://image.mux.com/${playbackId}/animated.gif?start=2&end=8&fps=15&width=320`;
```

**Example** - Animated preview of our pitch video:

![Animated GIF](https://image.mux.com/9dgSGD1XGzVm3YOSCslXgrgFbAkiKFCOksgXtUYlvDs/animated.gif?start=0&end=8&width=480)

### 6. Embeddable Player

Users get one-click access to embed code for any platform:

```html
<!-- Mux Player embed -->
<iframe
  src="https://player.mux.com/{playbackId}"
  width="640"
  height="360"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<!-- Or use the stream URL directly -->
<video controls>
  <source src="https://stream.mux.com/{playbackId}.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL">
</video>
```

## Why Mux Was the Right Choice

| Requirement | Mux Solution |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Fast integration** | Clean SDK, 10 lines of code to upload |
| **No infrastructure** | Mux handles encoding, CDN, player |
| **Auto-optimization** | Adaptive streaming out of the box |
| **Rich media features** | Thumbnails, GIFs, storyboards - all automatic |
| **Developer experience** | Excellent docs, predictable API |
| **Fair pricing** | Pay only for what you use |

Building README2Video with Mux took **minutes instead of days**. That's exactly the developer experience I wanted to pass on to my users.

## Challenges I Faced

### 1. Video Concatenation
Generating multi-scene videos (30s, 60s) required stitching multiple Sora 2 clips. Solution: FFmpeg with crossfade transitions on the server.

### 2. Long Generation Times
60-second videos (4 scenes) can take 5+ minutes. Solution: Server-Sent Events for real-time progress updates so users know exactly what's happening.

### 3. Free Tier Hosting Timeouts
Serverless platforms timeout during long generations. Solution: Deployed on Render as a persistent Node.js process.

## What's Next

- [ ] Mux Player React component for enhanced playback controls
- [ ] Auto-generated captions using Mux's transcription API
- [ ] Storyboard preview before final generation
- [ ] Webhook notifications when video is ready
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple READMEs
