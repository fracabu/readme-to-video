*This is a submission for the [DEV's Worldwide Show and Tell Challenge Presented by Mux](https://dev.to/challenges/mux-2025-12-03)*

## What I Built

**README2Video** is a web application that automatically transforms GitHub README files into professional promotional videos.

README.md → AI Analysis → Video Generation → Mux Streaming → Share!

Paste a GitHub URL, choose your style, and get a cinematic promo video in minutes. No editing skills required.

## My Pitch Video

{% embed https://stream.mux.com/9dgSGD1XGzVm3YOSCslXgrgFbAkiKFCOksgXtUYlvDs.m3u8 %}

> **Meta twist**: This pitch video was generated by README2Video itself, from its own README. The app pitched itself. 🎬

## Demo

- **Live App**: [readme-to-video.onrender.com](https://readme-to-video.onrender.com/)
- **GitHub Repo**: [github.com/fracabu/readme-to-video](https://github.com/fracabu/readme-to-video)

**Note**: The app uses BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) - you'll need API keys from Kie.ai, Mux, and an LLM provider (OpenRouter offers free models, or use your own Anthropic/OpenAI/Google key). This keeps the app free and gives users full control over their costs.

## The Story Behind It

Every developer knows this pain: you build something amazing, but creating a promo video takes hours (or days), costs money, and requires skills you don't have.

I wanted to solve this for myself and every developer out there.

The solution? Let AI do the heavy lifting:
1. **Analyze** the README to understand what the project does
2. **Generate** a compelling script with scenes
3. **Create** stunning visuals with Sora 2
4. **Host** on Mux for instant streaming

Now any developer can go from README to promo video in under 5 minutes.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **LLM** | Multi-provider: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, OpenRouter (free tier!) |
| **Video AI** | Kie.ai Sora 2 - cinematic text-to-video |
| **Streaming** | Mux Video API |
| **Real-time** | Server-Sent Events for live progress |

### Key Features

- **Multi-Provider LLM**: Choose between Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or free models via OpenRouter
- **Video Styles**: Tech, Minimal, or Energetic aesthetics
- **Durations**: 15s, 30s, or 60s videos
- **Real-time Progress**: SSE updates showing each generation step
- **BYOK Model**: Users bring their own API keys - no hidden costs

### Use of Mux (Additional Prize Category Participants Only)

README2Video doesn't just *host* videos on Mux - it **integrates Mux as a core feature** of the product.

### Mux Features Used

1. **Programmatic Upload API**
   - Videos are uploaded directly via the Mux Node SDK
   - No manual intervention required

2. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**
   - Generated videos stream smoothly on any device/connection
   - Mux handles all the transcoding automatically

3. **Embeddable Player**
   - Users get a ready-to-use Mux player link
   - One-click embed code for their own sites

4. **Playback URL Generation**
   - Each video gets a unique, shareable Mux URL
   - Perfect for social media and documentation

### Code Example

```javascript
import Mux from '@mux/mux-node';

const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET,
});

// Upload generated video to Mux
const asset = await mux.video.assets.create({
  input: [{ url: generatedVideoUrl }],
  playback_policy: ['public'],
  encoding_tier: 'baseline'
});

// Get streaming URL
const playbackId = asset.playback_ids[0].id;
const streamUrl = `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}.m3u8`;
```

### Why Mux Was the Right Choice

- **Developer-first API**: Clean, well-documented, easy to integrate
- **No infrastructure headaches**: Mux handles encoding, CDN, player
- **Reliable**: Videos just work, on any device
- **Fair pricing**: Pay only for what you use

Building README2Video with Mux took minutes instead of days. That's exactly the developer experience I wanted to pass on to my users.
